/*
Problem 1:
Our game has 2 characters, Mario and Shantae, both need to focus before executing their flagship actions, jump and dance respectively.

The following code model this behavior using the famous 3 runtime game object models. 
Your task: study this code, questioning every line.

Problem 2:
How do you implement a new player character, one that could dance and jump. Describe your solution for each of the architectures.

Problem 3:
About the generic components and the ECS approaches... How can we handle a game object that depends on a specific component of another game object.
Let us say, how can we implement that Mario can jump only when Shantae is dancing?, or viceversa, that Shantae can dance only when Mario is dancing?.
