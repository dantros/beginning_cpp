# Basic single file C++ examples

These set of examples aims to illustrate different features of the C++ programming language

- [hello_world.cpp](./hello_world.cpp) : Where it all begins!

#  Building the examples

As the examples are in a single file, you can try them easily with one of the following methods.
The recomendation is to try options 1 to 3 in order.

1. Copy-paste the source code to an online C++ compiler, such as: https://cpp.sh/

2. Using Microsoft Visual Studio CLI (Command Line Interface). Just open the 'Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022' and execute:

```
YOUR_WORKING_DIRECTORY> cl.exe your_program.cpp
```

Your folder will get 2 new files: your_program.obj and your_program.exe
To execute the code, run the exe file with

```
YOUR_WORKING_DIRECTORY> your_program.exe
```

And that's it :)
